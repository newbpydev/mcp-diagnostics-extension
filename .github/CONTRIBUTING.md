## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or 20.x (22.x recommended)
- npm 9.x or later
- VS Code 1.96.0 or later
- Git

### Project Stats (Current)

- **üèÜ 602 Tests Passing** (3 skipped, 0 failing)
- **üìä 95.45% Test Coverage** (exceeding 90% requirement)
- **üîß 34 Test Suites** covering all components
- **‚ú® v1.3.0** with cross-platform support

### Development Tools

We use the following tools for development:
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing and modern JavaScript features
- **Jest**: Unit and integration testing
- **ESLint**: Code linting and style enforcement
- **Prettier**: Code formatting
- **Wallaby.js**: Live testing feedback (optional but recommended)

## Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mcp-diagnostics-extension.git
   cd mcp-diagnostics-extension
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build and Test**
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   npm test
   ```

4. **VS Code Development**
   - Open the project in VS Code
   - Press F5 to launch Extension Development Host
   - Test the extension in the new VS Code window

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- **main**: Production-ready code, triggers stable releases
- **develop**: Integration branch for features, triggers pre-releases
- **feature/***: Feature branches for new functionality
- **bugfix/***: Bug fix branches
- **hotfix/***: Critical fixes that need immediate release

### Feature Development

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Follow TDD Approach**
   - Write failing tests first
   - Implement minimal code to pass tests
   - Refactor while keeping tests green

3. **Make Incremental Commits**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add diagnostic filtering functionality"
   ```

4. **Keep Branch Updated**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/develop
   ```

5. **Create Pull Request**
   - Push branch to your fork
   - Create PR against `develop` branch
   - Fill out PR template completely

## Testing

### Test Structure

```
src/test/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/           # Fast, isolated tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/    # Component interaction tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fixtures/       # Test data and mocks
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helpers/        # Test utilities
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run CI tests (no watch, coverage)
npm run test:ci
```

### Test Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage requirement (currently achieving 95.45%)
- **Integration Tests**: Cover component interactions
- **E2E Tests**: Full extension workflow validation
- **Cross-Platform Tests**: Windows, macOS, Linux compatibility
- **TDD Approach**: Write tests before implementation
- **Mocking**: Use proper VS Code API mocking

### Using Wallaby.js

If you have Wallaby.js installed:
- Tests run automatically as you type
- Real-time coverage indicators
- Runtime value inspection
- Performance monitoring

## Code Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use proper access modifiers (private, public, protected)
- Document public APIs with JSDoc

### Code Style

- Use ESLint and Prettier for consistent formatting
- Follow established patterns in the codebase
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/):

```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `ci`

## Pull Request Process

### Before Creating PR

- [ ] All tests pass (`npm run ci:check`)
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] Changes are documented
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated (if needed)
- [ ] Self-review completed

### PR Requirements

1. **Fill Out Template**: Complete all sections of the PR template
2. **Link Issues**: Reference related issues with `Fixes #123`
3. **Add Labels**: Apply appropriate labels (bug, feature, docs, etc.)

5. **Respond to Feedback**: Address all review comments

### PR Checklist

- [ ] Tests added for new functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Breaking changes documented
- [ ] Performance impact considered

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Checks

Every PR triggers:
- **Multi-platform Testing**: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- **Node.js Compatibility**: Tests on Node 18.x and 20.x
- **Security Scanning**: npm audit and CodeQL analysis
- **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, type checking
- **Performance Testing**: Bundle size and performance checks

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Test Stage**: Run all tests with coverage
2. **Security Stage**: Security audit and analysis
3. **Quality Stage**: Code formatting and build verification
4. **Package Stage**: Extension packaging (on releases)
5. **Publish Stage**: Marketplace publishing (on releases)

### Status Checks

All status checks must pass before merging:
- ‚úÖ Tests pass on all platforms
- ‚úÖ Code coverage meets threshold
- ‚úÖ Security audit passes
- ‚úÖ Code formatting is correct
- ‚úÖ Build succeeds

## Release Process
