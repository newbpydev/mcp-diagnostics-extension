This will guide you through creating a conventional commit.

## üöÄ Release Workflows

### Automated Release Workflow

#### Via GitHub Actions UI

1. Go to GitHub Actions ‚Üí "Release" workflow
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select branch (`main` for stable, `develop` for pre-release)
4. Choose release type:
   - `patch`: Bug fixes and minor updates
   - `minor`: New features
   - `major`: Breaking changes
   - `prerelease-alpha`: Alpha version
   - `prerelease-beta`: Beta version
5. Optional: Check "Dry run" to preview changes
6. Click "Run workflow"

#### Via Command Line

```bash
# Regular releases
npm run release              # Automatic version bump based on commits
npm run release:patch        # Force patch release
npm run release:minor        # Force minor release
npm run release:major        # Force major release

# Pre-releases
npm run release:alpha        # Alpha pre-release
npm run release:beta         # Beta pre-release

# Dry run (preview only)
npm run release:dry-run
```

### Release Workflow Steps

1. **Validation**
   - Run full test suite (552 tests)
   - Code linting and formatting
   - Security audit
   - Type checking

2. **Version Bump**
   - Analyze commits since last release
   - Determine appropriate version increment
   - Update `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

3. **Changelog Generation**
   - Generate CHANGELOG.md from conventional commits
   - Group changes by type (features, bug fixes, etc.)
   - Add commit links and contributor information

4. **Git Operations**
   - Create release commit
   - Tag with new version
   - Push changes and tags

5. **Build & Package**
   - Install dependencies
   - Run production build
   - Package extension as VSIX

6. **GitHub Release**
   - Create GitHub release with generated notes
   - Upload VSIX artifact
   - Mark as pre-release if applicable

7. **Marketplace Publishing**
   - Publish to VS Code Marketplace
   - Stable releases go to main channel
   - Pre-releases go to pre-release channel

## üß™ Pre-release Testing

### Alpha Testing Workflow

1. Create alpha release: `npm run release:alpha`
2. Install locally: `code --install-extension *.vsix`
3. Test core functionality:
   - Extension activation
   - MCP server startup
   - Diagnostic capture
   - Tool responses
4. Report issues with `[ALPHA]` tag

### Beta Testing Workflow

1. Create beta release: `npm run release:beta`
2. Publish to pre-release channel
3. Community testing period (1-2 weeks)
4. Collect feedback and bug reports
5. Address critical issues
6. Promote to stable release

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Extension activates without errors
- [ ] MCP server starts and responds to tools
- [ ] Diagnostics are captured correctly
- [ ] Status bar updates properly
- [ ] Commands work as expected
- [ ] Performance is acceptable (large workspaces)
- [ ] Memory usage is stable
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## üö® Hotfix Process

### When to Use Hotfixes

- Critical bugs affecting all users
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data corruption issues
- Extension fails to activate

### Hotfix Workflow

1. **Immediate Assessment**
   - Confirm severity and impact
   - Identify root cause
   - Estimate fix complexity

2. **Create Hotfix**
   - Branch from `main` if needed
   - Implement minimal fix
   - Write focused tests

3. **Emergency Release**
   - Use GitHub Actions "Hotfix Release" workflow
   - Provide clear description
   - Mark as emergency if critical

4. **Post-Hotfix Review**
   - Automated issue created for review
   - Plan proper fix for next release
   - Update documentation if needed

### Hotfix Commands

```bash
# Via GitHub Actions (recommended)
# Go to Actions ‚Üí "Hotfix Release" ‚Üí Run workflow

# Manual hotfix (if needed)
npm run release:patch
```

## üîß Manual Release Steps

If automated workflows fail, follow these manual steps:

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install required tools
npm install -g @vscode/vsce
npm install -g standard-version

# Ensure clean working directory
git status
```

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Prepare Release**
   ```bash
   # Run full CI check
   npm run ci:check

   # Create release (updates version, changelog, tags)
   npm run release
   ```

2. **Build and Package**
   ```bash
   # Package extension
   vsce package
   ```

3. **Create GitHub Release**
   ```bash
   # Push changes and tags
   git push --follow-tags origin main

   # Create release via GitHub CLI or web interface
   gh release create v1.0.0 *.vsix --generate-notes
   ```

4. **Publish to Marketplace**
   ```bash
   # Publish to VS Code Marketplace
   vsce publish --pat YOUR_PAT
   ```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Version Conflicts

```bash
# Reset to clean state
git checkout main
git pull origin main
npm ci

# Try release again
npm run release
```

#### Package Build Failures

```bash
# Clean build artifacts
npm run clean
npm ci
npm run compile:prod

# Check for linting errors
npm run lint
```

#### Marketplace Publishing Failures

1. Verify VSCE_PAT secret is configured
2. Check marketplace publisher permissions
3. Ensure extension name is unique
4. Verify package.json metadata

### Getting Help

- Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error information
- Review CHANGELOG.md for recent changes
- Open issue with `release` label for assistance
- Contact maintainers for urgent release issues

## üìä Release Metrics

Track these metrics for each release:

- Time from commit to published release
- Number of commits included
- Test coverage percentage
- Extension size (VSIX file)
- Download/install metrics
- User feedback and ratings

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

- Regularly review and update release process
- Automate additional checks as needed
- Gather feedback from contributors
- Monitor release success rates
- Optimize workflow performance
