## [1.2.2](https://github.com/newbpydev/mcp-diagnostics-extension/compare/v1.2.1...v1.2.2) (2025-06-09)

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Resolved dependency packaging issue preventing extension activation
  - Fixed `.vscodeignore` configuration to include critical runtime dependencies (`zod`, `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`)
  - Extension was failing to activate in packaged environments with "Cannot find module 'zod'" error
  - Development environment (F5) worked fine, masking the issue until packaging
  - All 334 tests passing, extension packages successfully (778 files, 1.11 MB)

### Added

- **Comprehensive Package Validation System**

  - Created `scripts/validate-package.sh` for automated dependency verification
  - Added `src/test/packaging/dependency-resolution.test.ts` with 12 comprehensive tests
  - Implemented dependency resolution validation for both development and packaged environments
  - Added performance impact monitoring for dependencies

- **Workflow Best Practices Documentation**

  - Created `docs/WORKFLOW_BEST_PRACTICES.md` with systematic dependency management protocol
  - Added `docs/CRITICAL_DEPENDENCY_FIX_SUMMARY.md` with comprehensive root cause analysis
  - Established pre-commit validation checklist and quality gates
  - Documented prevention measures for future dependency issues

- **Enhanced Package Scripts**
  - Added `validate-package` and `package:validate` npm scripts
  - Integrated validation into development workflow
  - Created automated dependency monitoring system

### Technical Details

- **Root Cause**: `.vscodeignore` excluded all `node_modules/`, including runtime dependencies
- **Solution**: Selective inclusion of critical dependencies while excluding development dependencies
- **Validation**: 12/12 dependency resolution tests passing, memory usage <0.01MB increase
- **Impact**: Zero dependency-related errors, both development and packaged environments working

### Prevention Measures

- Automated validation pipeline with pre-commit hooks
- Mandatory testing in both development (F5) and packaged (.vsix) environments
- Comprehensive dependency checklist for all new dependencies

## [1.2.1](https://github.com/newbpydev/mcp-diagnostics-extension/compare/v1.2.0...v1.2.1) (2025-06-09)

### Fixed

- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Resolved missing lodash dependency preventing extension activation
  - Fixed "Cannot find module 'lodash'" error that prevented extension from loading in packaged form
  - Replaced lodash dependency with custom debounce implementation to eliminate external dependencies
  - Extension now works correctly when installed from marketplace (.vsix package)
  - Issue only affected packaged extension, not Extension Development Host (F5) debugging

### Technical Details

- **Root Cause**: `.vscodeignore` excluded `node_modules/` which prevented lodash from being bundled
- **Solution**: Implemented native TypeScript debounce function replacing lodash.debounce
- **Impact**: Eliminates external dependency, reduces bundle size, improves reliability
- **Validation**: All 322 tests passing, no functional changes to extension behavior
